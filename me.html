    I am Adithya, scientist, full-stack developer and founder of Greppo. I am
    interested in working on web-applications, cloud-utility projects,
    data-science and AI/ML projects. Expertise include (waste)water management,
    GIS, Geospatial data, remote-sensing, process (chemical) systems
    engineering.

    I have a PhD from TU Delft on Domestic Slurry Hydraulics in Transport
    (D-SHIT), where I studied how shit flows. I have a Master of Science (MSc)
    in Process technology (Process Systems Engineering, Chemical Engineering)
    and a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in the same. I like looking into
    systems and understanding their behaviour, answering questions like how do
    they whatever they do, why do they do it and what influences it. I applied
    this to complex fluids (poop + water is one of them), because I find them
    fascinating; and got a PhD out of it.
