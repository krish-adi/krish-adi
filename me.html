<p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹ !</p>

<p>
    I am Adithya, scientist, full-stack developer, software engineer and a
    climber. I like working on web-applications or mobile applications,
    cloud-utility projects, data-science and AI/ML projects. Expertise include
    (waste)water management, GIS, Geospatial data, remote-sensing, process
    (chemical) systems engineering and digital twins.
</p>

<p>
    I have a PhD on 'how shit flows' (Domestic Slurry Hydraulics in Transport:
    D-SHIT) from TU Delft, where I studied the fluid dynamics of faecal sludge
    to design sewer systems. I have a Master of Science (MSc) in Process
    technology (Process Systems Engineering, Chemical Engineering) and a
    Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in the same. I like looking into systems
    and understanding their behaviour, answering questions like how do they
    whatever they do, why do they do it and what influences it. I applied this
    to complex fluids (poop + water is one of them), because I find them
    fascinating; and got a PhD out of it.
</p>

    I started building websites at 12, playing around with html and css. I first
    hosted a website of MIDI files, when I was playing the keyboard and had a
    Yamaha PSR 1000. I started writing algorithms to solve prolems in process
    systems at university. Used MATLAB quite a lot. I got into full-stack dev
    and building web-apps when I wanted to turn my research work into an
    interact-able app. I love working with Python and JavaScript. My stack at
    the moment includes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Starlette, FastAPI, Flask for the backend</li>
    <li>VueJS, ReactJS for the frontend</li>
    <li>TailwindCSS, Bootstrap for the CSS</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase for the database</li>
    <li>AWS, GCP for cloud utilities</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I also work on AI/ML projects that make use of Tensorflow. Currently, I am
    working on a service that is looking to provide a context aware consumer
    experience to a customer. Somewhere, in the intersection between AI and
    E-Commerce. More on that later...
</p>

<p>
    I also love to climb. I have climbed some long routes in the Italian
    Dolomites and climbed some beautiful routes on ice.
