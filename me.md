# Adithya Krishnan

I am Adithya, scientist, full-stack developer and founder of Greppo. I am interested in working on web-applications, cloud-utility projects, data-science and AI/ML projects. Expertise include (waste)water management, GIS, Geospatial data, remote-sensing, process (chemical) systems engineering.

I have a PhD from TU Delft on Domestic Slurry Hydraulics in Transport (D-SHIT). TL;DR I studied how shit flows. I have a masters in Process technology (Process Systems Engineering, Chemical Engineering) and a bachelors in the same. I like looking into systems and understanding their behaviour, answering questions like how do they whatever they do, why do they do it and what influences it. I applied this to complex fluids (poop + water is one of them), because I find them fascinating; and got a PhD out of it.

I like building software. I am a full-stack developer and make use of 
- Starlette, FastAPI, Flask for the backend 
- VueJS for the frontend 
- TailwindCSS, Bootstrap for the CSS 
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase for the database
- AWS, GCP for cloud utilities
